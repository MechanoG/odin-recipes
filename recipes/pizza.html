        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A baked dish originating in Italy, which consists of a flat, round, crispy leavened dough 
            covered with a layer of sauce and a layer of one or more toppings, such as meat, seafood, 
            vegetables, and fruit, which is often topped with a layer of cheese. A popular dish served 
            for all types of occassions and meals, Pizza is made as a sweet or a savory food that can 
            be enjoyed as a breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, or snack.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, Pizza is often considered to be a savory food made into a round shape and 
            cut into wedges for serving. However, as foods change, Pizza has evolved to be formed 
            into round, rectangular and square shapes with a wide variety of ingredients being used 
            to make the toppings for the baked crust. Sweet pizzas are often served for breakfast, 
            brunch, lunch, dessert, or as an appetizer while the savory varieties are most often 
            served for lunch, dinner, or as a snack.</p>
