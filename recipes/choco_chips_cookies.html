        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that features chocolate chips or chocolate 
            morsels as its distinguishing ingredient. Chocolate chip cookies are claimed to have 
            originated in the United States in 1938, when Ruth Graves Wakefield chopped up a Nestlé 
            semi-sweet chocolate bar and added the chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe; however, 
            historical recipes for grated or chopped chocolate cookies exist prior to 1938 by various 
            other authors.</p>

        <p>Generally, the recipe starts with a dough composed of flour, butter, both brown and white sugar, 
            semi-sweet chocolate chips, eggs, and vanilla. Variations on the recipe may add other types of 
            chocolate, as well as additional ingredients such as nuts or oatmeal.</p>
